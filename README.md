# WindowsFormsApps

A windows forms application with multiple small projects in it.

After choosing the application name from the radio buttons on the left side of the screen, after that, we choose a radio button that is about a solution with a method or a solution without using a method, and finally, we can get the result.

Screenshots from the project.
